# Flash Commands

## Export Library Images

Exports every bitmap on the library to a new file on a directory named `images`.
It'll also [export any symbols](http://help.adobe.com/en_US/flash/cs/extend/WSd5f4b6c52cfaa4b16a883d5c135312fa05c-8000.html) you've named with a `.png` extension, as a PNG sequence.


## Paste HTML as Text

Just copy some HTML and use this command to paste it as a [almost decent](https://github.com/blvz/lazy-s/blob/master/flash/commands/Paste%20HTML%20as%20Text.jsfl#L60), [formatted textfield](http://help.adobe.com/en_US/flash/cs/extend/WS5b3ccc516d4fbf351e63e3d118a9024f3f-7f59CS5.html) on Flash.

Use with the [Copy RTF as HTML service](https://github.com/blvz/lazy-s/tree/master/mac/services) to copy texts from Pages, Keynote, PDFs etc. and keep the basic formatting when pasting in Flash. Of course, it works better with a keyboard shortcut.
