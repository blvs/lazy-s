# Flash Commands

## Export Library Images

Exports every bitmap on the library to a new file on a directory named `images`.  
It'll also [export any symbols](http://help.adobe.com/en_US/flash/cs/extend/WSd5f4b6c52cfaa4b16a883d5c135312fa05c-8000.html) you've named with a `.png` extension, as a PNG sequence.


## Paste HTML as Text

Just copy some HTML and use this command to paste it as a [almost decent](https://github.com/blvz/lazy-s/blob/master/flash/commands/Paste%20HTML%20as%20Text.jsfl#L60), [formatted textfield](http://help.adobe.com/en_US/flash/cs/extend/WS5b3ccc516d4fbf351e63e3d118a9024f3f-7f59CS5.html) on Flash.

If you use this command together with the [Copy RTF as HTML Automator Service](https://github.com/blvz/lazy-s/tree/master/mac/services), you can copy texts from Pages, Keynote, PDFs and paste them on Flash as you always wanted or... maybe you just can't wait for the time you won't have to even open Flash again. And no one can blame you.
